I'm a Javascript developer and I started to learn golang. these are my resources which I'm using to learn GoLang:

1- course on Udemy by Steven Grider. This course is good for beginners and it teaches you the basics of Golang from hello world to go routines

2- Go by Example, which is a reference document that provides hands-on examples of Golang features.
