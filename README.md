# Hi, I'm Amin (You can call me Hershel)! üëã

I started learning Go with four years of experience in JavaScript/TypeScript development. If you're new to programming, I wouldn't recommend Go as your first language. There are many programming languages better suited for beginners, such as Python, JavaScript, and C++.

When I began, I wondered, ‚ÄúWhere should I start? Which resources are best for learning Go?‚Äù After some research, I found a great course on Udemy:

[Go: The Complete Developer's Guide (Golang)](https://www.udemy.com/share/101XnU3@rmnNwYPBSlfExPUhH-LKSql8ePnOqdWs6ACU9p_jypKU5ejj7FgMFNgm9rJteudb2Q==/)

This course is an excellent starting point for learning Go. It covers the basics like Go modules, program entry points, variables, functions, file organization, and data types, before moving on to more advanced topics like error handling and testing. Stephen Grider, the instructor, uses clear examples and charts to explain each topic, making it easier to understand.

Once I had a good grasp of the basics, I decided to build a simple application without using a database or external storage. I found a comprehensive list of Golang packages, libraries, and resources on this GitHub page:

To apply what I‚Äôd learned, I created a basic CLI application that manages a list of agencies associated with different regions, saving the data into two JSON files:

After completing that project, I started another one: a "todo CLI" application. I can see the progress I‚Äôve made in writing Go code through this project. If you check it out, you‚Äôll notice that I've implemented more advanced design patterns, like repositories, controllers, models, and storage utilities. It‚Äôs evolved beyond a simple todo CLI application:

Here are some additional resources that have helped me along the way:

1. **Go by Example:** A reference document that provides hands-on examples of Golang features.

2. **Web Development with Go:** Learn to build real, production-grade web applications from scratch.  
   https://www.usegolang.com/

3. **Mastering Go (Book):** A step-by-step guide for learning Go, which I used alongside other resources.
