First of all, I should mention that I started learning Go with 4 years of experience in JavaScript/TypeScript development. If you're new to programming, this path may not be ideal for beginners. In fact, I believe GoLang is not suitable for someone starting from scratch. There are many programming languages better suited for beginners, such as Python, JavaScript, and C++.

At the beginning, I was like: ‚ÄúOk, where should I start? Which website or tutorial is good to begin this journey?‚Äù

Then I found this course on Udemy:

[Go: The Complete Developer's Guide (Golang)](https://www.udemy.com/share/101XnU3@rmnNwYPBSlfExPUhH-LKSql8ePnOqdWs6ACU9p_jypKU5ejj7FgMFNgm9rJteudb2Q==/)

It is a great course to start learning the Go programming language. It covers basic topics like Go modules, pages, program entry points, variables and functions, file organization, and data types. It then moves on to advanced topics like error handling and testing.

One of the best aspects of this course is that the instructor, Stephen Grider, explains each topic using charts and clear examples.

After I understood the basics of Golang, I decided it was a good time to build a simple application without any database or external storage. I found a perfect list of Golang packages, libraries, and resources to use while building this application in this github page :

In addition to these resources, I decided to get some hands-on experience by implementing a simple application. I began by creating a basic CLI application that manages a list of agencies associated with different regions, saving the data into two JSON files.

2- Go by Example, which is a reference document that provides hands-on examples of Golang features.

3- Web Development with Go

Learn to build real, production-grade web applications from scratch.

4- Mastering Go (book)

This book serves as a step-by-step guide for learning the Go programming language, and I used it alongside other resources.
